          Hi, I'm Megan! I'm a high school student from the Chicagoland area. Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated science and technology. However, it took me a little longer to discover what I wanted to do within the STEM-field. Read more about my journey below.

      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <ul class="abouttimeline">
        <li>
          <p><strong>2015</strong> The meet cute</p>
          <p>I was first introduced to programming in third grade during our hour of code. It was love at first sight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>2021</strong> Kode with Klossy and Northwestern e-Focus Seminar</p>
          <p>After taking a break from coding, I applied and was accepted to Kode With Klossy, which runs free two-week summer coding programs for female and non-binary students. I participated in a virtual mobile application development course where I learned Swift and Xcode. During this summer, I also completed a two-week seminar on design thinking and communication through Northwestern.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>2021</strong> Chemistry with chemistry</p>
          <p>Unexpectedly, I discovered my love for chemistry a couple months into my general chemistry course. I dedicated hours to honing my chemistry skills and learning more about topics that facinated me.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>2022</strong> BinaryHeart</p>
          <p>During sophmore year I joined BinaryHeart, a club at my school that donates refurbished used computers to students in need of resources. I started working with four other peers on creating a website for BinaryHeart using JavaScript and CSS. Next school year, I will be the project manager for web development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>2022</strong> Girls Who Code and Kode With Klossy</p>
          <p>The summer before my junior year, I participated in the Girls Who Code self-paced summer immersion program where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with cybersecurity and cryptography. I also completed another virtual Kode With Klossy course, this time on data science.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>2022</strong> University of Pennsylvania Chemistry Research Academy</p>
          <p>For three weeks in Philadelphia, I learned about research through labs, lectures, and discussions.</p>
